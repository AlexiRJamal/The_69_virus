<h1>
The 69 virus
</h1>
<p>
Hehe, nice.
This does nothing.
A simple virus to fill your hard drive with text files that contain "69. Hehe, nice" over and over until either your command line crashes or your hard drive fills up.

Not a virus per se since it can easily be stopped.

Don't, and I mean it (please), use it for malicious purposes. I'm trying to find a job and I need my stupid github pushes to be filled up because they restricted access to my account because of stupid politics.
